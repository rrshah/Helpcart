Whether it’s a working woman or a housewife, she too needs help with the household chores, taking care of the children and the elderly. With so many responsibilities, she is hardly left with any ‘me’ time.
To make life easier for women, we came up with the idea of providing home help and driving services.Making use of the technological advances, these services can be provided at the click of a button. No more do women have to hunt for maids .They do not have to be dependent on others for travelling.
